# Install and Initialize

## 1. Client SDK installation

```npm
npm install chatty-client
```

### 1). Create dashboard account
- Go to [`dashboard`](https://dashboard.chatty-cloud.com)

### 2). Create new application
- Create new application by clicking the button '+ New App' at [`dashboard app`](https://dashboard.chatty-cloud.com/apps)

### 3). Get API key

![API key at dashboard app tab](/img/docs/dashboard-apikey.png)


## 3. Initialize

### 1). What to initialize

To use chatty-client sdk properly, need to initialize two things as below

- API key (generated at dashboard)
- Chat Member (user unique id and name of your service platform)


### 2). Where to initialize
- Place where can specify the member identification during application booting up
- And after member signin or login


<InfoBlock type="note">
• Even if init function is called multiple time, the member is not registered as a duplicate (member is always unique)
</InfoBlock>
<InfoBlock type="note">
• If member signout and signin again, the member id should be different with previous member id. especially, in case of third party oauth login, don't use provider's id as member id
</InfoBlock>


Below code is a part of App.tsx
```javascript
App.tsx

import Chatty from 'chatty-client';

...

const App = () => {
  const [ready, setReady] = React.useState(false);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!ready) {
      bootstrap().finally(() => {
        setReady(true);
      });
    }
  }, []);

  /*
   *
  When user id is specific, call init function
  Ex) 
  1. during application bootup process, 
  2. after user join or login
  */

  if (ready && user) {
    const missedCount = await Chatty.init({
      apiKey: CHATTY_API_KEY,     // API Key of your app that created in dashboard 
      member: {
        id: user.id,
        name: user.name,
        language: 'en',
        country: 'US',
        avatar: user.avatar,
        deviceToken: 'xxxxxxxxxx',
        group: '',
        data: {
          extraInfo: '',
        }
      },
    });

    // init method returns missedCount to use badge count in chat button
    // store the result to global state and use it
    store.dispatch(setChat({ missedCount: missedCount }));
  }

  return (
    <View>
    /* App Root Component*/
    </View>
  );

  ...

}
```

### InitPayloadType
```typescript
export interface InitPayloadType {
  apiKey: string;
  member: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    language?: string;
