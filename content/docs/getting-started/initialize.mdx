## 1. What to initialize

To use chatty-client sdk properly, need to initialize two things as below

- API key generated at dashboard
- Register user's id and name as a member to let sdk know who attend chat (we call your app's user as 'Member' )


## 2. Where to initialize
- Place where can specify the member identification during application booting up
- And after member signin or login


<InfoBlock type="note">
- Even if init function is called multiple time, the member is not registered as a duplicate (member is always unique)
- If member signout and signin again, the member id should be different with previous member id. especially, in case of third party oauth login, don't use provider's id as member id
</InfoBlock>


### Example

```javascript

import Chatty from 'chatty-client';


/*
 When identifier of user is specific, call init function
 Ex) 
 1. during application bootup process, 
 2. after new user join or login
 */

try {
  await Chatty.init({
    apiKey: CHATTY_API_KEY,     // API Key of your app that created in dashboard 
    member: {
      id: user.id,              // mandatory
      name: user.name,          // mandatory
      avatar: user.avatar,      // optional (url type started with 'https://')  
      deviceToken: 'xxxxxxxxxx' // optional 
      language: 'en'            // optional
      country: 'US'             // optional
    },
  })
} catch (err) {
  console.error('chatInit error', err);
}

```
