subtitle: 'Install chatty-client npm package and prepare cloud dashboard and How to initialize chatty sdk'
---

## 1. Client SDK installation

with npm
```npm
npm install chatty-client
```

with yarn
```yarn
yarn add chatty-client
```


## 2. Cloud Setup

It's needed to get API key to use sdk at client frontend. To do this, Create new application at [`dashboard`](https://devdashboard.chatty-cloud.com)

If your app is created, goto menu apps and then you can get API key

## 3. Initialize

### 1). What to initialize

To use chatty-client sdk properly, need to initialize two things as below

- API key generated at dashboard
- Register user's id and name as a member to let sdk know who attend chat (we call your app's user as 'Member' )


### 2). Where to initialize
- Place where can specify the member identification during application booting up
- And after member signin or login


<InfoBlock type="note">
- Even if init function is called multiple time, the member is not registered as a duplicate (member is always unique)
- If member signout and signin again, the member id should be different with previous member id. especially, in case of third party oauth login, don't use provider's id as member id
</InfoBlock>


### 3). Example

```javascript

import Chatty from 'chatty-client';


/*
 When identifier of user is specific, call init function
 Ex) 
 1. during application bootup process, 
 2. after new user join or login
 */

try {
  await Chatty.init({
    apiKey: CHATTY_API_KEY,     // API Key of your app that created in dashboard 
    member: {
      id: user.id,              // required (string type)
      name: user.name,          // required (string type)
      avatar: user.avatar,      // optional (string url type started with 'https://')  
      deviceToken: 'xxxxxxxxxx' // optional (string type)
      language: 'en'            // optional (string type)
      country: 'US'             // optional (string type)
    },
  })
} catch (err) {
  console.error('chatInit error', err);
}

```
