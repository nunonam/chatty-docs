# Install and Initialize
Install <b>[`chatty-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chatty-client)</b> npm package and prepare cloud dashboard and How to initialize chatty sdk

## 1. Client SDK installation

with npm
```npm
npm install chatty-client
```

with yarn
```yarn
yarn add chatty-client
```


## 2. Cloud Setup

It's needed to get API key to use sdk at client frontend. To do this, Create new application at [`dashboard`](https://devdashboard.chatty-cloud.com)

If your app is created, goto menu apps and then you can get API key

## 3. Initialize

### 1). What to initialize

To use chatty-client sdk properly, need to initialize two things as below

- API key generated at dashboard
- User's id and name as a member to let sdk know who attend chat (we call your app's user as 'member' )


### 2). Where to initialize
- Place where can specify the member identification during application booting up
- And after member signin or login


<InfoBlock type="note">
• Even if init function is called multiple time, the member is not registered as a duplicate (member is always unique)

• If member signout and signin again, the member id should be different with previous member id. especially, in case of third party oauth login, don't use provider's id as member id

Below code is a part of App.tsx
```javascript
App.tsx

import Chatty from 'chatty-client';

...

const App = () => {
  const [ready, setReady] = React.useState(false);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!ready) {
      bootstrap().finally(() => {
        setReady(true);
      });
    }
  }, []);

  /*
  When identifier of user is specific, call init function
  Ex) 
  1. during application bootup process, 
  2. after new user join or login
  */

  if (ready && user) {
    const missedCount = await Chatty.init({
      apiKey: CHATTY_API_KEY,     // API Key of your app that created in dashboard 
      member: {
        id: user.id,              // required (string type)
        name: user.name,          // required (string type)
        avatar: user.avatar,      // optional (string url type started with 'https://')  
        deviceToken: 'xxxxxxxxxx' // optional (string type)
        language: 'en'            // optional (string type)
        country: 'US'             // optional (string type)
      },
    });

    // init method returns missedCount to use badge count in chat button
    // store the result to global state and use it
    store.dispatch(setChat({ missedCount: missedCount }));
  }

  return (
    <View>
    /* App Root Component*/
    </View>
  );

  ...

}
```
